# Leonardo Static Site/Blog Generator

**Work in progress...**

Another static site/blog generator which integrates webpack, gulp.js and jekyll (which will be removed later as gulp will do his job).

For now you may be more interested in this other repository: https://github.com/ducksoupdev/gulp-site-generator

## TODO

* Fix webpack awesome-typescript-loader not ignoring node_modules.
* Integrate typedoc.
* Create example site with 3 pages and blog.
* Integrate Susy.
* Implement Vertical Rhythm.
* Create basic SCSS files structure.
* Last but not least, get rid of jekyll once gulp is doing all the work!
* Add SCSS linting.
