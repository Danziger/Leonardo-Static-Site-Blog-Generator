# Leonardo Static Site/Blog Generator

**Work in progress...**

Another static site/blog generator which integrates webpack, gulp.js and jekyll (which will be removed later once gulp is doing his job).

* Implement Vertical Rhythm.
* Create basic SCSS files structure.
* Add SCSS linting.
* Add gulp-cached: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cached
* Clean _dist directory once everything is moved.
* Last but not least, get rid of jekyll once gulp is doing all the work!
